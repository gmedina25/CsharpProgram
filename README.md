**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?**

These projects were created to help students register for classes. The first one needed to be a console app while the next one was a GUI.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this application?**

I believe my formatting of my code was well structured and organized.

**Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The console app was a very simple and barebones application that took very minimal user input in the form of numbers and letters. The WPF app was more of a streamlined experience for users with easy to use text boxes, drop downs and button. I allowed a person like my mom to test the program and she was able to register for three courses without a problem and she is not very tech savvy.

**How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?**

I used a careful and methodical approach of attention to detail, carefully scanning the code piece by piece. I was looking for small errors, for example, there was a case where return -4 was used but it didn't exist, so I replaced it with return 0. Attention to detail is something that will follow me for the rest of my proggramming career and if I don;'t hone that skill, I will be lost in a sea of code.

**Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?**

Having to learn more about if-else statements was an eye opener because they were the backbone of the WPF project. Without them, the program wouldn't be able to function at all.
